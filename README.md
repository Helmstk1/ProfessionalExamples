  I have been the club sponsor/coach of BACON (Best All-around Club Of Nerds) for over eight years, guiding dozens of truly amazing projects, championship-winning competitions, and international travel.

After procuring a local donor for 1,000 pounds of corn starch, I led <br/> the BACON students in constructing a large watertight tank out of scrap materials. <br/> We then created a 8 foot ooblek pool, so that the students could "walk on water." | <img src="/images/20151029_164135.jpg" alt="Student Walking on Water 2" style="width:400px;">
Dr. Mark Lepsch demonstrates some of the planned use cases for <br/>the micro-satellites used in the ThinSat competition. Students then <br/>worked with Dr. Lepsch and myself to design a LEO PCB and components to test. <br/>CHS was the only high school that I'm aware of that made it onto <br/>the ThinSat manifest, prior to the SpaceX ISS resupply explosion| <img src="/images/ThinSat.jpg?" alt="ThinSat Demo" style="width:400px;">
After stripping down a donated shopping scooter, modifying the gear ratio and <br/> upgrading the powertrain to a 48V motor system, I insisted that I should take<br/> the virgin test-run, for safety reasons.  This is the stickers that the students made <br/> for my birthday, as a prank / commemoration of the first time they saw a teacher do 30mph in a hallway. | <img src="/images/bacon%20scooter.PNG?" alt="Caught Speeding" style="width:400px;">
