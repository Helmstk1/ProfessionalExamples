After procuring a local donor for 1,000 pounds of corn starch, I led the BACON students in constructing a large watertight tank out of scrap materials.  We then created a 8 foot ooblek pool, so that the students could "walk on water." | <img src="/images/20151029_164135.jpg" alt="Student Walking on Water 2" style="width:400px;">
